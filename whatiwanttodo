I want to write a 3D engine that can both run blender rendered 3d meshes,
calculate collisions of objects, has a capable terminal, as well as several
ui elements and sound processing.

Roadmap:
- terminal 									[Done (sort of)]
- mesh render
- keyboard and mouse inputs (as terminal commands)
- ui
- physics (velocity, direction vectors, acceleration, mesh collisions, gravity)
- sounds
- other physics (heat, mist and other visible gasses, water, airflow / wind)

basic program structure:

main.cpp is the primary c++ script
initialize terminal
mainloop.hpp

  - inherit terminal values
  - change default terminal values to custom ones
  - load and display UIs and meshes
  - give control over mouse & keyboard
  - give control over clocks (multi-threading)
